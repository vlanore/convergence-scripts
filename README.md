This is a collection of scripts to perform pre and post processing of data for convergence detection tools.

Notable scripts include:
 - [annotate-diffsel.py](script/annotate-diffsel.py), a tool to annotate phylogenetic trees with conditions (typically, convergent or non-convergent). It uses the graphical interface of ete3 to help annotate the trees. Currently, the output format is that of [diffsel](https://github.com/vlanore/diffsel) (i.e., it encode conditions as branch length).
